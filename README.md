# TMS
Task Management System

Service that manages tasks, their deadlines, sends notifications. \
Look for openapi.yml to check out the backend api.

Dev Containers vs code extension may be used for comfortable development.

## Internal useful commands

Some commands that you may find useful during development:

* `su -s /bin/bash user` - change user to "user".

## Makefile

Makefile contains typicaly useful targets for development:

* `make build-debug` - debug build of the service with all the assertions and sanitizers enabled
* `make build-release` - release build of the service with LTO
* `make test-debug` - does a `make build-debug` and runs all the tests on the result
* `make test-release` - does a `make build-release` and runs all the tests on the result
* `make service-start-debug` - builds the service in debug mode and starts it
* `make service-start-release` - builds the service in release mode and starts it
* `make` or `make all` - builds and runs all the tests in release and debug modes
* `make format` - autoformat all the C++ and Python sources
* `make clean-` - cleans the object files
* `make dist-clean` - clean all, including the CMake cached configurations
* `make install` - does a `make build-release` and runs install in directory set in environment `PREFIX`
* `make install-debug` - does a `make build-debug` and runs install in directory set in environment `PREFIX`
* `make docker-COMMAND` - run `make COMMAND` in docker environment
* `make docker-build-debug` - debug build of the service with all the assertions and sanitizers enabled in docker environment
* `make docker-test-debug` - does a `make build-debug` and runs all the tests on the result in docker environment
* `make docker-start-service-release` - does a `make install-release` and runs service in docker environment
* `make docker-start-service-debug` - does a `make install-debug` and runs service in docker environment
* `make docker-clean-data` - stop docker containers and clean database data

Edit `Makefile.local` to change the default configuration and build options.
